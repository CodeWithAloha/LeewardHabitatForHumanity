- `'/'` home page looks okay
- `'/mission'` has a broken image in the left sidebar that links to '/?page_id=34'
- `'/advocacy'` the `<h2>` "Cost of Home", should that be "_Cost of a Home_"? (same applies to the first sentence of the paragraph) 
  - _scratch that_ they use it as a hashtag #CostofHome (still don't like it ðŸ˜†)
- `'/staff-board'` a few things here:
  - image sizes are inconsistent
  - Skidget's title overflows? to a new line under the image. None of the other titles do this
  - nit: they could really use some new/better staff images, especially Jo's
- `'/build_site_volunteers'` the max width set on the container is breaking the layout on larger screens (especially the top `<strong>` tag)
  - nit: the feature-image is taking up a lot of prime real estate above the fold
    - idk if the layout on this page is intentional cuz it's super weird when inspecting with dev tools
- `'/partners'` idk...nothing is really broken here but imo the layout is wonky af
- `'/home-ownership'` pretty aight 
  - _future consideration: could use a table for the "Income Guidelines" fam size and ygi_
- `'/home-repairs-rehab'` pretty aight
