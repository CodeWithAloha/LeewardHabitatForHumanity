# 12-17-2022 CFH Habitat for Humanity Meeting Notes

## Current Processes
### Item Donation and Inventory Process
* People will either call their number or visit their website to inquire about donating an item
* They will get redirected to an email address to send the information about the item
* The person will send their name, number, item name, pictures of the item, and other qualifying item characteristics
* If HfH accepts the item, they will pick it up if the location is within a certain distance of the warehouse
  * HfH is not allowed inside the house, so the item's owner must place it outside ready for pickup 
  * Pickup days are on Thursdays
* If the person is calling from Town, they will have to drop the item off at the warehouse themselves
* Different questions are asked about the item to determine whether HfH will accept it
  * Is the item an appliance? 
  * How old is the item?
  * List of items that are not accepted are on the website
    * This list changes (for example, closet doors will no longer be accepted due to not have tracks) 
* When the item is accepted, they determine the price by looking at comparable items on Google and marking it off by half or adjusting if there are missing items
* The item is then listed on Craig's List
  * Occasionally Facebook Marketplace
* Smaller items are not kept track of
* There's no internal tracking of items
* If the item is in the warehouse too long, it gets put in the free bin
* Only inventory is cabinets


## Potential Website Features
* Request to have two different donation buttons, one for donating money and one for donating items
  * Item donations could have a form that helps with the initial questionnaire/Chatbot
    * What is the pickup spot's zip code?
    * What is the item?  
    * How old is it?
    * Is it one of the items on the not accepted list?
* A featured items list
  * This would prevent having to do inventory for the entire warehouse
  * They are currently trying to push cabinets
